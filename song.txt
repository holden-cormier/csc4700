Holden Cormier - Song Lyrics
Song - Moon

I wanna go to the moon
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
I wanna go to the moon
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How could I get through?)
Hmm, hmm, here we go strappin', we up
Never forget all the memories
Sittin', I sip out my cup
Thinkin' I should be a better me
Truly I'm blessed from the start
So much to say in these melodies, oh
Stare at the sky, the moon singin' sweet
Oh my God, such a sweet moment
Angels, they say I'm not ever weak, such a lonely moment
Heaven knows I might never sleep, trouble in my soul
Hey, I've been prayin', life can be drainin', oh
Hey, we were late, tryna keep haulin' on
I'm ashamed, hated what I will see
And nobody knows, so I go
How can I get through? (Don't leave so soon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
How can I get through? (To the moon)
Early afternoon, I wanna go to the moon (take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (whoa)
Don't leave so soon
How could I get through? (Yeah)
How can I get through? (Ooh)
Early afternoon
I wanna go to the moon (ooh, take you to the moon)
Don't leave so soon (ooh)
Don't leave so soon (don't leave so soon)
How could I get through? (How can I get through?)
Yeah-yeah, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
